<h1>Fun Rules</h1>
<p>The full tournament will follow a particular tournament style out of those listed on the Formats page, usually selected at the end of the previous tournament. Each player may, for any match in the tournament, choose to follow a particular ruleset out of those listed on the Rulesets page. Should their opponent agree, then the ruleset is prioritised over the rules of the character pick, should they contradict. A tournament style may lead to certain rulesets being forbidden for some or all matches.</p>
<p>Any failure to follow a ruleset constitutes a foul, and the player responsible must forfeit a single round, unless their opponent signals otherwise by immediately also committing a foul in response. Remember, the goal of this tournament is just some silly fun!</p>
<h1 id="boring-rules">Boring Rules</h1>
<p>The tournament is organised by Janet, who has the final say in enforcement of the tournament&#39;s rules. Others may help organise it, in which case they should also be considered a tournament organiser for the purpose of the rules.</p>
<p>Players from any region may participate. Participants must join the Discord server and add Janet as a friend in Fantasy Strike, along with any other tournament organisers who request it, for the purpose of streaming matches. Known troublemakers may be barred from tournaments at the organiser&#39;s discretion for the sake of the other participants. Forms of troublemaking include repeated intentional rule-breaking and bigotry.</p>
<p>The tournament will be in the swiss format, unless stated otherwise by the tournament style. Scores should be reported via a text message of the form &quot;[@ tournament organiser] [username 1] beats [username 2] [score]&quot;, for example &quot;@Janet Alice beats Brob 3:2&quot;. Note that in the case of a best of 3 single battle, this is the individual games won, and in the case of a best of 1 team battle, this is the characters won with.</p>
<p>Participants must check in during the 10 minutes preceding the tournament. For each round, participants will be notified of their next match, at which time they should add their opponent as a friend on Fantasy Strike. If their match is to be streamed, they will next be told this and that they should connect to their opponent but not yet start the match, else this step will be skipped. Then everyone will be told to start their matches. If, at this point, anyone is not available for their match, they have 15 minutes to arrive before being considered to have forfeited the match, or 5 minutes if they have not checked in.</p>
<p>As such the sequence of events for a participant, for each match, is as follows: They will be told their next opponent. They may be told their match will be streamed, in which case they will be told to connect to their opponent. They will be told to start their matches, at which point they should do so.</p>
<p>If the ping between two participants in a match is too high or unstable for both to consider it playable, and either participant is clearly at fault for this, that participant will be considered to have forfeited the match, otherwise one participant will be picked to forfeit at random with a 50% chance of either.</p>
