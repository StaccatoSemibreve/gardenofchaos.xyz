<p>(Yomi is a fighting game term meaning the art of &quot;reading&quot;, AKA predicting, the opponent.)</p>
<p>There are many ways a player can control a match, which you can categorise however you want, but which I view as part of 2 general categories: aggressive yomi and passive yomi. These will dominate how it feels to face an opponent, as well as what a match involving them will look like on both good and bad days. Players will generally use tools from each, but some players particularly excel with particular tools.</p>
<p>Aggressive yomi is reading by controlling - a player with aggressive yomi will trick you, or goad you, or bait you, or condition you, or even just subtly tempt you into using the option they want, then act accordingly. When facing this at its best, it feels like you're being actively taken apart as your every move turns out to, in fact, be their move. That throw there? That was their idea first, before you ever even knew it would be an option. At its worst, it feels impulsive, like you're facing someone who keeps making bad decisions extremely confidently.</p>
<p>Passive yomi is reading by prediction - a player with passive yomi will gain an understanding of your behaviour, spot patterns, pay attention to what you've done so far and what you want to do now, then act accordingly. When facing this at its best, it feels like you keep guessing wrong as you try to win mixups or neutral and instead find them picking the perfect counter, despite surely having no way to know what you would do there. At its worst, it feels exactly the opposite way round, you keep guessing right somehow regardless of how confident you are in any given choice because they are somehow always picking the wrong answer.</p>
<p>Each of these has fascinating impacts and utility at different points in a game, and fall deeper than the art of predicting the opponent.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#aggressive">Aggressive Yomi, the Art of the Setup:</a></strong></p>
<p>A game with aggressive yomi players is a game that will take twists and turns. It will be unpredictable, as whichever player might have advantage, the other player might regain the lead at any point using these tools.</p>
<p>Its techniques are risky, able to gain advantage where there appears to be none, able to gain the edge in a match or cement a lead, but also able to completely undo any advantage and lose the match for you if it fails - and, as with all yomi tools, it will fail sometimes.</p>
<p>Two of the most notable aggressive yomi tools are baits and conditioning. A bait is a move or setup that tricks the opponent into using a punish that won't actually work - for instance, if the opponent doesn't know what a safejump is, they may try to beat it with an invincible reversal on wakeup, then find themselves getting punished. This is textbook aggressive yomi, where you make your opponent want to do something then make it hurt when they do. Conditioning is a more subtle tool, which in its simplest form is where you use lots of certain options to convince your opponent you're using them too much, then switch over to punishing their response. This can even be adapted to convincing them you're conditioning them and then keeping using that particular option, if they tend to overthink things!</p>
<p>In other words, these are manipulations of &quot;donkey space&quot;: the wonderfully named idea that, when your opponent plays incorrectly, you can be better off for making use of that error rather than continuing to play as normal! Baits are a way to use knowledge tests or tricks to pull people into making mistakes, and conditioning is a way of playing wrongly and then turning the tables when your opponent adapts.</p>
<p>This is most valuable when you can't avoid taking this risk, ie, when you're losing a round and need to catch up, as in other situations it can be a needless risk. Characters with more explosive damage are better for utilising this.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#passive">Passive Yomi, the Art of Just Knowing:</a></strong></p>
<p>A game with passive yomi players is a game that will be tense but consistent, where one player will take the lead and then keep it until they win the round, avoiding risks that would allow a dramatic shift.</p>
<p>There is no specific tool that can be used for passive yomi - instead, it's made up of a lot of pattern recognition and situational awareness, on top of game knowledge and strategy. A key part of it is that you avoid risks, never significantly deviating from the safest way to play even if you're utterly certain of what your opponent will do. Instead, you use slight deviations every so often to get the edge that little bit, avoiding the risk of conditioning. Those occasional slight deviations are based on what you expect your opponent to most often do in such a situation, based on past behaviour and what you believe they would benefit from most. You must never fall for baits, instead using your game knowledge to recognise them for what they are.</p>
<p>In other words, passive yomi is subtle manipulation of safe play, where on the whole you rely more on the safe play than on the deviation thereupon. In-depth knowledge is called upon to avoid baits and use the right move in every situation, and subtlety is used to avoid conditioning. The less your opponent tends to use aggressive yomi tools, the less subtle you can be for the same amount of risk.</p>
<p>This is most valuable when you are already winning, or at least in a similar position to your opponent, as in other situations it tends not to give enough of an edge to recover the round. Zoners are better for utilising this.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion:</a></strong></p>
<p>While players will typically use some of each type of yomi, and they could easily be categorised in all sorts of ways (and I highly advise doing this to aid your intuition), a strong understanding of these will be a big help in matches, both for recognising your own tendencies and your opponents'.</p>
<p>It may seem that passive yomi would be more effective, aggressive yomi wins out in its <em>potential</em> - you can far more actively choose to utilise it, and the players who utilise it best can be quite frankly terrifying when push comes to shove.</p>
<p>So practise both sides, favour the passive options when you don't need that edge, but don't be afraid to pull out the big guns!</p>
