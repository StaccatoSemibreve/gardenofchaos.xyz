        <h1>The Garden of Chaos</h1>
        <p>A low-stakes weekly <a href="https://www.fantasystrike.com/">Fantasy Strike</a> tournament based around following silly rulesets at every step, run by Janet (you know, from the Fantasy Strike Discord server, also other places) with logos and general design by Danielizabeth Stretulch (who is awesome btw)! If you wish to watch, please use the stream link from the navigation bar, and if you wish to participate, please use the signup and discord links.</p>
        
        <p>This week&#39;s tournament format is: <b>Chaotic</b>:</p>
        <blockquote>
            Team battle, best of 1. You must play with a ruleset for at least game in each match, and decide ahead of time which game(s) (by number - eg, game 1, game 3). The rulesets are then chosen at random using <a href="/random">a random selector</a> - if the players do not agree on the ruleset selections they may reroll up to 3 times.
        </blockquote>
        <p>It will be run on Thursday the 27th of August at 21:00 BST (20:00 UTC, 13:00 PDT, 16:00 EDT). This week it will be commentated by Janet and Danielizabeth Stretulch! ^_^</p>
