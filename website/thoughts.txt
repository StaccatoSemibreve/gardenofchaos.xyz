        <h1>Janet's Thoughts on Stuff (hosted on Garden of Chaos for convenience)</h1>
        <p>Hopefully eventually a bunch of useful documents where I summarise some useful stuff!</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/thoughts/throws">Throws:</a> the fundamentals of the strategy behind throwing - when you should, why you should, how often you should, and when it's a bad idea.</li>
            <li><a href="/thoughts/dice">How to Dice:</a> how to use Lum's dice roll - what to do once they're out, and how to get them out in the first place.</li>
            <li><a href="/thoughts/advantage">Advantage:</a> a guide on advantage, a major part of the game that newer players (and older players!) tend to struggle with.
