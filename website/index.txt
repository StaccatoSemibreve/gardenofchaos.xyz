        <p>This week&#39;s tournament format is: <b>Roll the Dice!</b>:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Roll the Dice:</strong> Single battle, best of 3, standard counterpick. At the start of the tournament, select six characters and number them from 1 to 6. Each match, roll a d6 (physical or digital) to select your character. The loser of a game can &quot;counterpick&quot; by repeating the process.
        </blockquote>
        <p>It will be run on Thursday the 16th of July at 21:00 BST (20:00 UTC, 13:00 PDT, 16:00 EDT). This week it will be commentated by Janet and Remy! ^_^</p>
