        <h1>The Garden of Chaos</h1>
        <p>A low-stakes weekly <a href="https://www.fantasystrike.com/">Fantasy Strike</a> tournament based around following silly rulesets at every step, run by Janet (you know, from the Fantasy Strike Discord server) with logos and general design by Danielizabeth Stretulch (who is awesome btw)! If you wish to participate or watch, please use the bracket or stream links respectively from the navigation bar. You can also find a list of upcoming Fantasy Strike events in the Events page.</p>
        
        <p>This week&#39;s tournament format is: <b>The Battle of Flagstone</b>:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>The Battle of Flagstone:</strong> Single battle, best of 3, no counterpicks. All players are grouped into two teams, where they must each play from a given set of characters, chosen on a per-tournament basis. The teams play sequential matches against each other according to a <a href="https://gardenofchaos.xyz/teams">custom team battle manager</a> (or, well, a <a href="https://gardenofchaos.xyz/teams2">simplified one</a>) until one team wins. The teams in question are the original Fantasy Strike characters vs the new ones.
        </blockquote>
        <p>It will be run on Thursday the 23rd of July at 21:00 BST (20:00 UTC, 13:00 PDT, 16:00 EDT). This week it will be commentated by Janet and Danielizabeth! ^_^</p>
