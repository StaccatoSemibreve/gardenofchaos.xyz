				<li><a href="#Roll the Dice" name="Roll the Dice"><strong>Roll the Dice:</strong></a> Single battle, best of 3, standard counterpick. At the start of the tournament, select six characters and number them from 1 to 6. Each match, roll a d6 (physical or digital) to select your character.

				<li><a href="#Democracy" name="Democracy"><strong>Democracy:</strong></a> Single battle, best of 3. At the start of the match, each player chooses their opponent&rsquo;s character, and the loser of a game may counterpick by changing their opponent&rsquo;s character.</li>
				<li><a href="#Mirror Mayhem" name="Mirror Mayhem"><strong>Mirror Mayhem:</strong></a> Single battle, best of 3, no counterpicks. Both players must pick the same character, chosen randomly from the cast. Only rulesets that do not contradict this character choice may be played. After losing a game, a player may counterpick by repeating the random selection process for both players.</li>
				<li><a href="#The Many and the Few" name="The Many and the Few"><strong>The Many and the Few:</strong></a> A random number is picked from 1-5 at the start of each match. That is how many characters are in the participants' teams, using a team battle manager. If 1, simply do a 1v1 match. Best of 1, unless it&rsquo;s 1v1 in which case best of 3.</li>

				<li><a href="#Teams" name="Teams"><strong>Teams:</strong></a> Single battle, best of 3, no counterpicks. All players are grouped into two teams, where they must each play from a given set of characters, chosen on a per-tournament basis. The teams play sequential matches against each other according to a custom team battle manager until one team wins.</li>
				<li><a href="#Play Fair" name="Play Fair"><strong>Play Fair:</strong></a> Single battle, best of 3, standard counterpick. At the start of every match, both players are separately assigned a random (non-mirror) ruleset.
