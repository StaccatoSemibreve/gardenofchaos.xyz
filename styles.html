<h1>Tournament Styles</h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Deck:</strong> Single battle, best of 3, standard counterpick. Each character can only appear in one match in the tournament, including matches with custom movesets - if you run out of characters, you forfeit.</li>
  <li><strong>Choose Your Enemy</strong>, aka <strong>Cursed</strong>, aka <strong>Vice Versus:</strong> Team battle, best of 1. At the start of the tournament, you select the team that every one of your opponents will play throughout. [Source: GRAG]</li>
  <li><strong>Roll the Dice:</strong> Single battle, best of 3, standard counterpick. At the start of the tournament, select six characters and number them from 1 to 6. Each match, roll a d6 (physical or digital) to select your character. You can &quot;counterpick&quot; by repeating the process, but if you land on the same character again through this process, you lose the match by default.</li>
  <li><strong>Democracy:</strong> Single battle, best of 3. At the start of the match, each player chooses their opponent&#39;s character, and the loser of a game may counterpick by changing their opponent&#39;s character.</li>
  <li><strong>Mirror Mayhem:</strong> Single battle, best of 3, no counterpicks. Both players must pick the same character, chosen randomly from the cast. Only rulesets that do not contradict this character choice may be played.</li>
  <li><strong>The Many and the Few:</strong> A random number is picked from 1-5 at the start of each match. That is how many characters are in the participants&#39; teams, using <a href="/teams.html">a team battle manager</a>. If 1, simply do a 1v1 match. Best of 1, unless it&#39;s 1v1 in which case best of 3.</li>
  <li><strong>Simplify:</strong> The winners&#39; bracket has teams of 3. The losers&#39; bracket has teams of 2, using <a href="/teams.html">a team battle manager</a> . Best of 1. [Source: Daniel Stretulch] [Double Elimination only]</li>
  <li><strong>Lawful:</strong> Team battle, best of 1. You must play with a ruleset for at least one game in each match, and decide ahead of time which games (by number).</li>
  <li><strong>Chaotic:</strong> Team battle, best of 1. You must play with a ruleset for at least game in each match, and decide ahead of time which games (by number). The rulesets are then chosen at random using <a href="/random.html">a random selector</a> - if the players do not agree on the ruleset selections they may reroll up to 3 times.</li>
  <li><strong>[Secret Update-related Name]:</strong> The players are grouped into two teams, where one team plays only the original cast and one team plays only the new characters. They play sequential matches against each other until every player on a team has won at least once, at which point that team wins the tournament.</li>
