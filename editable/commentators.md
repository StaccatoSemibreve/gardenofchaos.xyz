# [Commentators](commentators)
A bunch of self-description and self-promotion for any present or past commentators on Garden of Chaos.

**Janet:** (she/her) I'm just someone doing her best to be kind.  
I started the Garden of Chaos, and have the following things to say: trans rights, black lives matter, and ACAB! :D  
You can find me at [@janet@isacutie.net](https://isacutie.net/@janet) on the fediverse, @staccato.semibreve:matrix.org on matrix, or Janet#3389 on discord.  
My FS mains are Degrey, Lum, and Midori, though I've previously also mained Valerie and Geiger, and dabbled in Jaina.

**Danielizabeth Stretulch:** (he/she) I'm a mathematician, punster, and (Sporatic) Fantasy Strike commentator.  
Feel free to use Dan, Liz, or Beth or any other nickname you can find in my name.  
You can find me as [@DanielStretulch](https://twitter.com/DanielStretulch) on Twitter, [danielstretulch](https://twitch.tv/danielstretulch) on twitch, and [Daniel Stretulch](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKVW-6arRYF3nzpvWbwbnUg) on YouTube.  
My FS mains are Geiger, Setsuki, and DeGrey. Jaina, Midori, and Rook are my secondaries.

**Remy77077:** find me under that name basically everywhere (including in FS).  
I'm also known as "Agoners" for my pure gaming 'content' which is [my website](https://agoners.wordpress.com) and I also run [twitter](https://twitter.com/agoners), [twitch](https://twitch.tv/agoners) & [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHh8puoYhQf4d459Xz_YUFAs) under the name "Agoners" which all have a lot of FS content!  
My current FS mains are: Grave, Midori and Geiger.
