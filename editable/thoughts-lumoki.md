# Janet's Thoughts on Lum's Oki Tools

A fundamental part of this genre of fighting game is "oki", short for okizeme, which is a set of strategies to follow when you have your opponent knocked down to make use of that advantaged state. If your character has strong oki tools, that will allow you to make very good use of any knockdown, and will make knowing those tools extremely valuable. Lum is a character with strong oki tools.

In particular, Lum has a very versatile set of oki tools, letting you adjust according to your opponent's habits and levels of confusion and decision paralysis very effectively. I'll attempt to summarise them here, both for Lum players and their victims. Unless specified otherwise, assume these are spaced off forward throw.

If at any point you don't understand any of these, I recommend going into practise mode and trying them out! They're much easier to perform than to describe.

## [Item toss oki:](#item)

Upon knocking down the opponent, toss an item then decide what to do based on that item. Usually go for throw after this, as the opponent will most likely be pushing buttons, but some players will respond correctly at which point you must decide how to adjust. Your key options are: throw, nA comboed into either roll or another item toss, or if you threw them in the corner, an ambiguous crossup roll (note that the crossup is reactably unsafe on hit, so you will be thrown! only use the crossup if it's to kill or will combo)!

This is his classic oki, and mathematically the best one around - unless your opponent or circumstances give you a reason not to, go for this! This can be used at a very basic level of "throw almost every time" which will be effective at anything but high levels of play, and at the highest level of play knowing how to adapt this properly is still extremely powerful. Throwing is also the one you "want" to do most of the time as, while it does less damage, it lets you repeat the oki. Note that for brevity I'm not including the risks of parries and reversals, as they should be fairly clear and would make this… pretty long. Here I will attempt to detail the various options from each item:

<a name="safemelon" />

## [Safemelon:](#safemelon)

After a forward throw or yomi counter, wait a brief moment, jump, and immediately throw a melon. They have to block it! If they reversal, you will land and be able to block them, then punish accordingly. This means you can always get 1 free chip.

You can also always safely get an item toss after any blocked melon - caveats:

* Versus Grave, it must be at max range so you outspace dragonheart
* Versus Valerie, it must be a low melon so you outspeed chromatic orb
* Versus Onimaru, it must either outspace nA or be a low melon to outspeed his reversal options

<a name="safemelon2" />

## [Corner Safemelon:](#safemelon2)

In particular, a safemelon after a forward throw in the corner let's you item toss (or blockstring/combo with melon?) completely safely, and even gives you an opportunity to go for a tick throw afterwards, or combo into nA if they don't block! Note that this is too far to combo into roll unless you use fjC, which requires a slight delay before the item toss.

So if they have an invincible reversal, decide whether you expect them to use it (if so, safemelon into item toss into block), else decide whether you expect a yomi counter and thus whether you will perform the tick throw or use your nAxB / nAxC accordingly.

This is generally your safest option in the corner, and gives you plenty of chances to toss out items while keeping them in the corner so you can eventually get a favourable item for your item toss into ambiguous crossup roll oki, while dealing chip, while threatening a mixup each time. Here are some tips on what you should do based on the item:

<a name="roll" />

## [Ambiguous Crossup Roll:](#roll)


After a forward throw or yomi counter, wait X amount of time (you'll have to figure it out for yourself in practise mode) and roll, or if they're in the corner, time it by throwing an item first! (If you already have an item out, this will take too long, time it manually)

After a backward throw, this is also possible, and easier due to the wait being much shorter when timing it.

Okay, this one's mostly not great, but hear me out! No one blocks the crossup. No one! Well, some people do, but not many! While the crossup is unsafe on block or hit, as it has the same recovery as normal roll but leaves you closer, this doesn't matter if they don't block it and it's their last health point, because you just won.

Also, it can combo into items for extra damage and *maybe* becoming safe on hit.

Basically, this is your kill move, though you can abuse it against anyone who doesn't know what to do against it!

<a name="jump" />

## [Ambiguous Crossup jA:](#jump)

After a forward throw or yomi counter, walk forward for X amount of time, forward jump, and use jA - this is an ambiguous crossup! They have to guess right or you'll combo for 3 damage, if they do you can deal 1 chip or throw out an item if you don't expect them to punish the item toss. I admit, I barely use this one as it can never loop, it's kinda hard to space right, and a skilled opponent is often very good at blocking ambiguous crossups consistently, but it's good if you've got items around to confuse them or make it more powerful.

<a name="whiffroll" />

## <a href="#whiffroll" name="whiffroll">Whiff Roll:</a>

Next, we have the whiff roll oki, or the "Janet special" as Remy calls it (because I adore using this one!). It is mathematically eh, but it makes use of mental advantage (see [my thoughts on advantage](/thoughts-advantage)) to be extremely powerful.

**Instructions:** After a forward throw or a yomi counter, just press roll. Immediately. Do nothing else. From there, stand still and wait. Note that if you roll into the corner, you'll leave the corner automatically unless you delay!

Many opponents will try to throw you, either because they throw when they panic or because they reacted as if you hit them, because throwing is the correct response to a crossup roll. Now you've just got a free yomi counter, giving you a free 1 damage, oki, and full super meter. You can mix and match with other oki tools, such as HR, to make sure they never get the hang of this. Use it lots to show off, annoy them, and give them a chance to learn. You could even fuzzy guard here!

Note that it's better to go for HR here if you expect a throw, which will counterhit the throw, but you don't get to loop it, you don't get free super meter, and you don't get the style points. Also, versus exclusively human Midori, if they try to throw you can neutral jump into jA into HR, for 3 damage!

There is, of course, more to it - of course there is, it's psychological! I'll describe the likely responses per-character per-type-of-person here, but note that if they respond correctly then you should stop using it immediately.

## [Closing Thoughts:](#closing)

As you have no doubt noticed, Lum has some… rather complex oki tools. However, most Lum players will never learn them in as much detail as they're written here - there's a reason for this: you don't have to learn these by heart!

Instead, simply feel the joy of being a panda, learn the basic tools rather than the in-depth setups, and improvise as you go along. This is the tried and true method of playing Lum.

However, if you suspect you may have missed some damage in a particular situation, refer back to here to see what your options were in detail! You'll be sure to see whether you did miss damage, and how to fix it if you did.

If you find an option better than is listed here, or a new setup, please inform me so I can add it to the list! The goal of this is to be as comprehensive as possible, within reason! But I included tossing a minilum then throwing then tossing a minilum then throwing then tossing an item earlier, so not much reason honestly.

Good luck on the ultimate quest of winning rounds off a single throw. Prove to everyone that they should fear the mighty panda, even as they laugh at your antics!!! Mwahahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!
